This is a repo with collections of works I did on image processing.  
### Image Classification  
- [Cat or Dog?](https://github.com/hsin-you-wu/Image_processing/blob/main/cat-dog-classifier-computer-vision.ipynb) : Fast.ai  
- [Male or Female?](https://github.com/hsin-you-wu/Image_processing/blob/main/gender-classification-computer-vision.ipynb) : Fast.ai  

### Image Segmentation  
- [Colorful & Grayscale Images' Object Detection](https://github.com/hsin-you-wu/Image_processing/blob/main/Image_Segmentation.ipynb) : K-means & threshold segmentation, COCO dataset, YOLOv11 Model -> This is the best work so far! It is written in google colab along with explanations.
