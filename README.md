# Fast.ai_practice_kaggle  
Hi! I'm learning ML with fast.ai, so this repo is where I keep my kaggle notebooks.  
Since I can view the printed outputs without running each cell here on github, I think this would be handy if I want to review the stuffs later.  
Each notebook contains my note and practices on a certain topic of ML.
